## YesAlps Ski Booking Web App

**Problem**  
YesAlps had no product comparable to modern booking and marketplace experiences.

**Approach**  
I built a Java web app concept inspired by Airbnb/Booking flows, and added a ski-slopes layer by scraping and integrating slope data directly.

**Result**  
An end-to-end prototype combining backend development, data collection, and interactive map navigation.

## TIM / CladAG Churn Classification Challenge

**Problem**  
Identify high-risk churn users for TIM, Italy's largest telecom operator.

**Approach**  
I designed a churn classification pipeline with feature engineering and robust model validation.

**Result**  
I won the challenge.

## Kaggle Modeling Portfolio

**Problem**  
Show practical ability to explore datasets and build strong predictive models across different domains.

**Approach**  
I published notebooks covering exploratory analysis, gradient boosting models, and neural network workflows with reproducible evaluation.

**Result**  
Kaggle Code Master, career-high world rank: **#163**.

## LightGBM Inference-Time Feature Importance

**Problem**  
Standard feature importance methods are often disconnected from real-time scoring behavior.

**Approach**  
I implemented and documented a method to compute feature importance at inference time for tree-based models.

**Result**  
Published as open-source code and a technical article.
